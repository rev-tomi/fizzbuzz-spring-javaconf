# fizzbuzz-spring-javaconf
This project is one of a series that explores a couple of Dependency Injection solutions. It uses the Famous [FizzBuzz Kata](http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/index.pl?KataFizzBuzz) to demonstrate the different approaches.

This particular project demonstrates how you can use the setter injection of [Spring](https://spring.io/) with [Java Config](http://docs.spring.io/spring-javaconfig/docs/1.0.0.M4/reference/html/) to decompose FizzBuzz into smaller objects.
